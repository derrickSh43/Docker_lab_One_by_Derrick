# Lab 1: Linux Command Line Basics for DevOps

### 1. Navigating the File System

Use these commands to explore the Linux file system:

`pwd` - Print the current working directory

`cd` - Change the current directory

`ls` - List directory contents

Task:
Use `pwd` to display your current directory.
Then, use `cd` to navigate to `/home` and `ls` to list its contents.

### 2. Managing Files and Directories

Work with files and folders using these commands:

`touch` - Create an empty file

`mkdir` - Create a new directory

`rm` - Remove a file

`cp` - Copy a file

`mv` - Move or rename a file

Task:
Create a directory named `devops_lab` with `mkdir`.

Inside it, create `lab.txt` using `touch`.

Copy `lab.txt` to `backup.txt` with `cp`.

Remove `backup.txt` using `rm`.

Rename `lab.txt` to `task.txt` with `mv`.

### 3. Working with Processes

Monitor and manage processes with these tools:

`ps` - View current processes

`top` - Monitor processes in real-time

`kill` - Terminate a process by PID

Task:
Use `ps` to list processes.

Run `top` to observe resource usage.

Use `kill` to stop a non-essential process (e.g., `top`).

### 4. System Information and Networking

Check system stats and network with these commands:

`df -h` - Show disk usage

`free -h` - Show memory usage

`ping` - Test connectivity

Task:
Use `df -h` to check disk space.

Use `free -h` to check memory.

Ping `google.com` to test connectivity.

### 5. Basic Text Processing

Process text files with these utilities:

`cat` - View file contents

`grep` - Search for patterns

`sed` - Edit text streams

Task:
Use `cat` to view `task.txt`.

Use `grep` to find a word in `task.txt`.

Use `sed` to replace text in `task.txt`.

### 6. Managing Users and Permissions

Control access with these commands:

`chmod` - Change file permissions

`chown` - Change file ownership

`useradd` - Add a new user

Task:
Use `chmod` to make `task.txt` owner-readable only.

Create a user `clouduser` with `useradd`.

Change `task.txt` ownership to `clouduser` with `chown`.
